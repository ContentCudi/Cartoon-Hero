<h1> Do We Think We Have This Figured Out Yet?</h1>
<p>I have no idea how people can code with such effiency and ease. This shit is ridiculous but shout out to those who can. I want to make this a hobby and to be able to do stuff with this but boy does it feel overwhelming at first. Let hope I can keep this a thing that I work on daily!</p>
